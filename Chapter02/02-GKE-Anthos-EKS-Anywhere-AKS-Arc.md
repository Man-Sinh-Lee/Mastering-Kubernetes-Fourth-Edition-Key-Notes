Running managed Kubernetes on bare metal or virtual machines (VMs) provides the flexibility of on-premises infrastructure combined with the benefits of managed Kubernetes services. Hereâ€™s a detailed look at using Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) Anthos, Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) Anywhere, and Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) Arc:

### GKE Anthos

GKE Anthos is Google Cloud's platform for managing Kubernetes clusters across hybrid and multi-cloud environments. It allows you to run GKE clusters on-premises, on Google Cloud, and in other clouds, providing a consistent Kubernetes experience.

#### Features:
- Hybrid Cloud Management: Unified management of clusters across on-premises, Google Cloud, and other clouds.
- Service Mesh: Built-in Istio for secure service-to-service communication.
- Policy Enforcement: Centralized policy management with Anthos Config Management.
- Application Modernization: Tools for containerizing existing applications and deploying new ones.

#### Steps to Deploy GKE Anthos On-Premises:
1. Prepare Infrastructure:
   - Ensure you have compatible hardware or VMs with necessary resources.
   - Set up networking and storage as per Anthos requirements.

2. Install Google Cloud's Anthos On-Prem (GKE On-Prem):
   - Install the `gkectl` command-line tool.
   - Configure your cluster using configuration files.

   ```yaml
   gkeCluster:
     name: my-gke-cluster
     controlPlane:
       replicas: 3
       vmConfig:
         cpus: 4
         memoryMB: 8192
     nodePools:
       - name: default-pool
         replicas: 3
         vmConfig:
           cpus: 4
           memoryMB: 8192
   ```

3. Deploy the Cluster:
   ```bash
   gkectl create cluster --config cluster-config.yaml
   ```

4. Manage the Cluster:
   - Use Google Cloud Console or `kubectl` to manage the GKE Anthos cluster.

### EKS Anywhere

EKS Anywhere is Amazon's solution for running EKS clusters on your own hardware. It extends the EKS experience to on-premises environments, providing a consistent Kubernetes environment.

#### Features:
- Consistent EKS Experience: Same Kubernetes distribution as in EKS.
- Integration with AWS Services: Integrate with AWS services like IAM, CloudWatch, etc.
- Cluster Lifecycle Management: Simplified cluster creation, management, and upgrades.

#### Steps to Deploy EKS Anywhere On-Premises:
1. Prepare Infrastructure:
   - Ensure compatible hardware or VMs with required resources.
   - Set up networking and storage according to EKS Anywhere requirements.

2. Install EKS Anywhere CLI:
   - Install `eksctl` and `eksctl anywhere`.

   ```bash
   curl -LO "https://github.com/weaveworks/eksctl/releases/download/latest_release/eksctl_Linux_amd64.tar.gz"
   tar -xzf eksctl_Linux_amd64.tar.gz -C /usr/local/bin
   curl -LO "https://github.com/aws/eks-anywhere/releases/download/v0.5.0/eksctl-anywhere-v0.5.0-linux-amd64.tar.gz"
   tar -xzf eksctl-anywhere-v0.5.0-linux-amd64.tar.gz -C /usr/local/bin
   ```

3. Configure the Cluster:
   - Create a configuration file for your EKS Anywhere cluster.

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: anywhere.eks.amazonaws.com/v1alpha1
   kind: Cluster
   metadata:
     name: my-eks-cluster
   spec:
     controlPlaneConfiguration:
       count: 3
       machineGroupRef:
         name: cp-machines
     workerNodeGroupConfigurations:
       - count: 3
         machineGroupRef:
           name: worker-machines
   ```

4. Create the Cluster:
   ```bash
   eksctl anywhere create cluster -f cluster-config.yaml
   ```

5. Manage the Cluster:
   - Use AWS Management Console or `kubectl` to manage the EKS Anywhere cluster.

### AKS Arc

AKS Arc extends Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) to on-premises, edge, and multi-cloud environments. It allows you to manage Kubernetes clusters and applications consistently across diverse environments.

#### Features:
- Centralized Management: Manage Kubernetes clusters from the Azure portal.
- GitOps and Policy Management: Use Azure Policy and Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes to enforce policies.
- Integrated Azure Services: Leverage Azure services like Azure Monitor, Azure Security Center, etc.

#### Steps to Deploy AKS Arc On-Premises:
1. Prepare Infrastructure:
   - Ensure you have compatible hardware or VMs with necessary resources.
   - Set up networking and storage as per AKS Arc requirements.

2. Connect Kubernetes Cluster to Azure Arc:
   - Register your cluster with Azure Arc using the CLI.

   ```bash
   az connectedk8s connect --name my-aks-cluster --resource-group myResourceGroup
   ```

3. Install Azure Arc Extensions:
   - Install required extensions for monitoring, policy enforcement, and GitOps.

   ```bash
   az k8s-extension create --name azuremonitor-containers --cluster-name my-aks-cluster --resource-group myResourceGroup --cluster-type connectedClusters
   ```

4. Manage the Cluster:
   - Use Azure portal or Azure CLI to manage the AKS Arc-enabled cluster.

### Conclusion

Running managed Kubernetes on bare metal or VMs with GKE Anthos, EKS Anywhere, and AKS Arc provides a consistent and managed Kubernetes experience across different environments. Each solution integrates seamlessly with its respective cloud provider, offering a unified approach to managing Kubernetes clusters and applications both on-premises and in the cloud. Choose the solution that best fits your infrastructure, cloud provider preferences, and operational requirements.
